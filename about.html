      <h1 class="what-is-livehack">What is LiveHacks?</h1>
      <p class="livehack-text">LiveHacks is a collection of live hackathon projects presented by the community and makers themselves. So many cool projects can come out of a hackathon, but most are forgotten immediately or not easily accessible to the public. However, many of these projects aim to make peoplesâ€™ lives easier (life hacks!) and could be extremely useful to others. LiveHacks is a place to showcase these projects and get the non-hacker community involved. </p>
      <h1 class="what-is-hackathon">What's a hackathon?</h1>
      <p class="hackathon-text">Hackathons are events where people code and design new projects in a short period of time (typically 24-48 hours only!). The projects can adhere to a certain theme, aim to solve a given problem, or just be anything that a team wants to create. Not all hackathon projects go live and are usable by everyone, but all of the ones on LiveHacks are!</p>
